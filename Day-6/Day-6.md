# Week - 2  

## Homework

1. Please select a data.
1. Retrive your data and briefly explain the significant contents of your GSE and GPL files.
1. Write an introduction related to the selected topic. Why did you select that data? (Give a brief information about your topic: for example, if you selected a disease, you can explain its reasons, symptoms, importance, incidence, etc.). If you selected an organism apart from human, you can also explain the importance of this organism. The introduction part should be max half-page.

### Overview of systems biology
System Biology -> understanding of the biological processses in a cell/organism in a holistic framework

_An interdisciplinary research field_ (e.g., biology, chemistry, computing sciences, mathematics, and medicine)

_System Biology is based on_ use of **omics technologies** to obtain for _construction of models_ of complex biological systems and diseases.

###  Omics Technologies

Omics technologies, which systems biology brings, are valuable tools for comprehensive analyses. Automated DNA sequencers enabled the sequencing of genomes; microarray and mass spectrometry analysis permit global transcriptional profiling and lead to large-scale proteomic and metabolomics analysis. These high-throughput data need to be interpreted by bioinformatics. 

1. -**omics**: the scientific fields studying of the complete set of molecules within an organism (characterization & quantification)
    1. Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, epigenomics, etc.
1. -**ome**: the objects used in an -omics field (e.g., whole genes in an organism: genome)
    1. Genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome ...
