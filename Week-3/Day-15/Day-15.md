1. I've already done subnetwork analysis and combining ppi network with my geo2r data before (you may have a look at this via [here](https://github.com/enesbasbug/System_Biology_Internship_Notebook_2021/blob/main/Week-3/Day-14/Day-14.md)).
1. You may also find that specific ppi network given by tutor in Day-15 folder. [HERE](https://github.com/enesbasbug/System_Biology_Internship_Notebook_2021/tree/main/Week-3/Day-15)
1. Today, I'd like to focus on hub nodes and gProfiler analyses.

    1. I was going to choose a node that was called Expectation (INEs)
#

    1. I found this entrez id in Node Table below, and copied the HGNC value

    1. Go GeneCards.org (In order to investigate our hub node -> paste HGNC value.

    1. There you are. You got plenty of information about that gene. You may have a look at this via [here](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=HLA-DMB&keywords=HLA%5C-DMB)
