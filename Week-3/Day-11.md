## Biological Network
1. Graph Theory
    1. Nodes : Vertex, Proteins, genes, islands...
    1. Edges : Lines, Links between nodes
    1. Degree : Number of edges of a node
    1. Hub nodes : High degree nodes
1. Types of Edges  
    1. Undirected
    1. Directed
    1. Weighted
1. Representation of the Network
    1. List
    1. Adjacency Matrix 

## Topological Propertoes of Network
1. Path length : shortest distance between any two nodes
1. Average path length : Mean path length between all pairs of nodes
1. Diameter :  The longest of the shortest path lengths between any two node
1. Scale-free networks : Most of the nodes have low number of neighbours and there are small number of hub nodes

## Types of Biological Networks
1. Protein - protein interaction networks
1. Gene / transcriptional regulatory networks
1. Cell signalling networks
1. Metabolic networks

## Protein - protein Interaction Networks
1. Duameter of the network is small (small-world)
    1. efficient and quick flow of signals within the network
1. Scale-free
    1. a small number of nodes with high degree (the hubs) and a large number of nodes with a low degree

## PPI Databases
1. Experimental (Primary) PPI Databases
    1. BioGrid, MINT, IntAct, ...
1. Predictive PPI Databases
    1. String, UniHI, ...
1. Metadatabases
    1. APID, PINA, ...
