# Subnetwork Discovery
1. Context specific subnetwork discovery
1. Integration of omics data extract maximal connected sub-networks
1. By mapping the omics data such as gene expression data on a molecular interaction network, the relations between genes become easy to see
1. Identify specific parts of a biological system, which are more affected than others.

# Key Pathway Miner

## Cytoscape
1. It allows to adjust outcomes as an image
1. Either Greddy or ACO might be used

## Standalone
1. The fastest
1. It allows to analyze with different parameters
1. It gives outcomes as a file not a visual
1. Either Greddy or ACO might be used

## Web
1. It gives outcomes as an image
1. Internet connection is necessary
1. Only Greedy might be used

We had a look at this [website](https://keypathwayminer.compbio.sdu.dk/keypathwayminer/)
# 
And then, We try to run with a default database on the website. However, it didn't worked well when we pressed to start. There was a problem for sure.

Eventually, we try to use KPM via Cytoscape by downloading 'keypathminer' from App Manager in the app.

 The tutor showed us how to use KPM in the Cytoscape, and did an example.
