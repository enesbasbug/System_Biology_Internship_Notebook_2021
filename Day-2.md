## DNA Microarray measurement of gene expresion
 
_A basic protocol for a DNA microarray is as follows:_

1. Isolate and purify mRNA from samples of interest.
1. Reverse transcribe and label the mRNA
1. Hybridize the labeled target to the microarray
1. Scan the microarray and quantitate the signal

### What is cDNA?
**Complementary DNA** (cDNA) is a copy of a region of a strand of DNA. For example, if the original DNA stand had a sequence of ATT, the complementary sequence will be TAA. The cDNA will bind to the complementary site on the DNA strand.


### What is cRNA?
**Complementary RNA** (cRNA) is a copy of a strand of RNA that will bind to the appropriate region of the original molecule. If the original RNA stand had a base sequence of AUU, for example, the sequence of the cRNA strand would be UAA.

## A typical RNA-seq experiment consists of the following steps:

1. Design Experiment. Set up the experiment to address your questions.
1. RNA Preparation. Isolate and purify input RNA.
1. Prepare Libraries. Convert the RNA to cDNA; add sequencing adapters.
1. Sequence. Sequence cDNAs using a sequencing platform.
1. Analysis.

## What are Introns and Exons?

Introns and exons are nucleotide sequences within a gene. Introns are removed by RNA splicing as RNA matures, meaning that they are not expressed in the final messenger RNA (mRNA) product, while exons go on to be covalently bonded to one another in order to create mature mRNA.

Introns can be considered as **in**tervening sequences, and exons as **ex**pressed sequences.
