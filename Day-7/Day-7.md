## Different Expression (DE) Analysis

1. Multiple interactions between tens of thousands of molecules -> _inherent complexity biological process_
1. Indentification of _quantitative changes_ between _different groups/conditions_
    1. E.g., healthy cells vs tumour cells (two-color cDNA microarrays can be used!)
1. **Understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation**

##

1. A basic approach is **fold change!**
    1. The simplest method
    1. No need biological replicates
    1. **No real statistics!**
1. _Statistical significance test:_
    1. Parametric test (e.g., use of the mean and standard deviation)
    1. Nonparametric test (no need for any parameters)
