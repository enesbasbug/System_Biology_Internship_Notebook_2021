Report should include the following parts:
1. An introduction about your data based on literature (recall the first homework in this week)
1. A brief information about your data file (GSE & GPL). You must give the data & sample numbers and contents at least (recall the first homework in this week). 
1. Differential gene expression analysis to identify significantly changed genes using GEO2R or Rstudio (you can use a "multiple testing correction method" if you have a high number of significantly changed genes). You should interpret the most significantly changed genes (several genes with the lowest p-values) based on the literature. 
1. Hierarchial clustering analysis & heatmap through a tool or software (GEO (Dataset Cluster Analysis)/ shinyheatmap interface/ Rstudio - you can select one of them)
1. GO/pathway enrichment analysis (you can use any tools like g:Profiler)
