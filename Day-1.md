## **What is transcriptomics?**

Definition: 
*“The branch of genetics, that study the total RNA or mRNA present in a cell or tissue and related technologies used to study it, is called transcriptomics.”*

Or

_“Using the high throughput technologies such as microarray or RNA-seq; studying the transcriptome- a total set of mRNA prsent in a cell is known as transcriptomics”_


###### Before making the decision to go with RNA sequencing or microarrays, several questions must be answered.

### Practical Questions

1. What genome information is available (if any) for my species of interest?
1. How much data analysis expertise do I have or have access to?
1. How much money do I have to spend?

### Project Goals

1. Is accurate, absoulte quantitaion important?
1. Is it important to discover novel genes?
1. Do I want to be able to distinguish isoforms and the expression difference between the isoforms?
1. Am I interested in transcripts likely to be expressed at very low or very high levels?
1. Am I interested in structural information such as alternative splicing and gene fusions?

## Microarrays

1. Robust, reliable method, proven oover decades of use
1. High through-put method – 1000s of samples analyzed per month
1. Streamlined handling – can be easily automated
1. Straightforward data analysis
1. Short turn-around time – 5 days
1. Lower cost

1. Dependent on prior sequence knowledge
1. Cannot detect structural variations
1. Cannot detect isoforms
1. Hybridization and sample labeling biases
1. Not an absolute quantitation method

## RNA Sequencing

1. Provides a comprehensive view of the transcriptome.
1. Not dependent on any prior sequence knowledge.
1. Increased dynamic range and tunable sensitivity.
1. Can detect structural variations such as gene fusions and alternative splicing events.
1. A truly digital solution (absolute abundance vs relative abundance)

1. Technology is new to most researchers
1. Data storage is more challenging
1. Analysis is more complex – no standard protocol
1. Specialized computing infrastructure and personnel are required
1. More expensive than microarray
